  <div class="post">
    <p>I&rsquo;m a software developer born and raised in La Paz, Bolivia.</p>

<p>I started my university studies at <a href="http://www.ucb.edu.bo">Universidad Privada Boliviana</a> in 2011. The career I was pursuing was simply &ldquo;Systems Engineering&rdquo;. I didn&rsquo;t finish my degree there. Instead, I transferred to <a href="http://www.upb.edu">Universidad Privada Boliviana</a> in late 2012 because the program was much more interesting. I finished all my courses in July 9, 2018 and I&rsquo;m currently working on my thesis to get my degree in Computer Systems Engineering. In college I was involved in a few entrepreneurships all related to app development in Bolivia.</p>

<p>I mostly write iOS apps in both Objective-C and Swift, though I adopted the latter in the first version and have been using it almost exclusively since then. I have published many apps in the App Store throughout the years, and many have come and gone. I published my first app in 2011 when I was a college freshman; it was a simple numerical base converter which I was using for my computer science classes at the time. My most popular app is <a href="https://www.mignori.com">Mignori</a>, which used to be on the App Store, but I removed it to publish a better version sometime this year.</p>

<p>For a few years, I was involved in the iOS Jailbreak community, because doing basic reverse engineering to Apple&rsquo;s apps (and other people&rsquo;s apps) in order to make them behave differently was fun. I used to write tutorials for Jailbreak development in my blog. I stopped jailbreaking sometime in 2014 or 2015, so I am no longer involved with the community.</p>

<p>During college, I started working as a freelancer iOS developer. I was lucky, because iOS developers are a minority in Bolivia, so finding freelancing jobs was not hard. I&rsquo;ve worked for various clients, most notably  <a href="http://www.bz-group.com">BZ Group</a>, one of the biggest marketing and software development houses in the country.</p>

<p>I also use other technologies and languages. PHP is another language I use a lot - whether that&rsquo;s a good or a bad thing, I&rsquo;ll leave it up to you to decide. I have built a few Android apps in Java as well, but I was never interested in developing that skill much further beyond that. In general, I enjoy learning programming languages of all kinds and purposes, but the ones I use the most are a few - Swift, Objective-C, and a classical webstack with PHP, MySQL and Apache.</p>

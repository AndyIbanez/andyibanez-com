AIiCloudSync AIiCloudSync is a simple Package written in Swift to synchronize specific UserDefaults with the iCloud Key Value store (NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore).
To use this package, create a single instance of AIiCloudSync, and keep a reference to it. Once you create it, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about it any longer. It will automatically sync changes between iCloud and your local UserDefaults through the lifetime of your application. You can optionally receive notifications when the iCloud Syncs change so you can react accordingly.</description>

fsduplicates helps you find song duplicates recursively in any specific directory and output its findings in a different directory. With the generated results you can later analyse and take action on duplicate songs. The results are in plain text files, which you can analyse using any tool, like Unix standard commands, or fsduplicates’ tools.</description>

These services allow developers to share code snippets faster to either request help with an specific piece of code, or to help others with theirs (Other uses may apply).</description>

If you want to protect app data from your friends or family that are constantly asking for your iDevice, there are a couple of things you can do: You can tell them not to enter certain apps, empowering their curiosity and therefore exposing your private data, or you can passcode-lock certain apps, which if they see, they will just wonder what you’re hiding that they can’t see.</description>

      <description>Discontinued project. Developed in 2013.
A friend of mine had his hardware ringer of his phone die on him. Because of that, toggling the ringer on and off was quite a chore for him. Without installing SBSettings or anything equivalent to that, he had to go to the settings app and toggle the ringer on and off there.
So he asked me to write an icon on SpringBoard that would toggle the ringer.</description>

      <guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/projects/sideswitch-toggles/</guid>
      <description>Discontinued project. Developed in 2012.
Sideswitch Toggles is a MobileSubstrate tweak that gives you full control over your iPhone’s Ringer (and as such, it isn’t available for the iPod Touch). The tweak simply modifies the action that happens when you toggle the ringer on and off.
By default, Sideswitch Toggles comes with the ability to toggle Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Airplane Mode, and Do Not Disturb. The capabilities of Sideswitch can be easily extended by other developers.</description>

      <description>Discontinued project. Developed in 2011
SiLight is a small AssistantExtension that allows Siri to turn on your phone’s torch to use it as a flashlight. SiLight is a real quick flashlight, since commands work in the Lockscreen too. SiLight was programmed having natural speech in mind, instead of talking to her like a robot (“flashlight on”) you can ask her as you would ask anyone (“I need a flashlight”, “Siri, there’s a blackout”).</description>

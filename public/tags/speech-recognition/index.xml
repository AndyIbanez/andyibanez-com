      <description>As iOS becomes more advanced, features that we thought belonged to the long future start becoming more common place in today&amp;rsquo;s software. One such feature is speech recognition, which allows a device to take verbal input from a user, transcribe it into text, and do something with it.
In iOS, we can do this using a framework called Speech, and an object called SFSpeechRecognizer. With this class, you can perform all kinds of speech recognition tasks.</description>

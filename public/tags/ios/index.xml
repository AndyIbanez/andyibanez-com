      <description>We have reached the point in which computers are really fast. Especially Apple&amp;rsquo;s, as they have control of both the hardware and software, so, oftentimes, some tasks that could be sped up with multithreading, are not necessary anymore. But, for those cases when you do need multithreading, we have many options available.
On Apple&amp;rsquo;s platforms there is a surprising amount of concurrency tools. You are likely familiar with the most used one, the Grand Central Dispatch, DispatchQueue, which is pretty good and it covers the vast majority of use cases.</description>

      <description>Intercepting iOS Network Request Calls with Proxyman
Working with network APIs can be tricky, especially when debugging. You oftentimes have to ask yourself if your app is sending and receiving the expected information. You also often worry about whether the web service returns whatever it promises it will return. Working with APIs is both easy and tricky due to all the implications behind the scenes. What happens if the service goes down and sends unexpected responses?</description>

      <description>Happy New Years everyone! To kick off this year, I wanted to write a non-technical article. This time I want to focus on a topic that you won&amp;rsquo;t find in many other places, and that is what it is like to hunt for iOS jobs in Bolivia, and what my experience has been like being one here. By the end of this article, you will hopefully understand a very different market compared to countries such as the USA, and you will be able to make a decision on whether this is a field you want to pursue or not.</description>

      <title>Quick Tip: Hosting JSON Files on Github for Free</title>
      <link>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/quick-tip-hosting-json-files-github-for-free/</link>

      <guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/quick-tip-hosting-json-files-github-for-free/</guid>
      <description>There are times in which you may want to host small JSON (or other small types of files) somewhere because your app needs them. Maybe you want to configure feature flags, or maybe you want to host IAP identifiers somewhere so as to not hardcode them in your app. This last case is something I did recently.
The immediate thought will be get a cheap server somewhere - after all, using something like Vultr you can get cheap hosting for as low as $2.</description>

      <title>Parsing Tricky JSON With Codable in Swift</title>

      <guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/parsing-tricky-json-codable-swift/</guid>
      <description>If you have been writing Swift in the past couple of years, you have probably been using Codable (which is really just the composition of Decodable and Encodable in the same protocol).
If you have been writing iOS apps for longer, you likely know about JSONSerialization as well, which is the backbone of Codable and it allows you to do more manual work when parsing JSON, seemingly giving you more control.</description>

      <description>I had announced that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to write an article this week due to it being Elections Day in my country. that said I just can&amp;rsquo;t leave you guys without article, so this is a short one.
We will write another NSFormatter subclass. It will allow us to compose E-mails easily. This should also help show that formatters can format string into anything else really.
In short, we will be able to &amp;ldquo;compose&amp;rdquo; emails using raw strings, like this:</description>

      <description>Last year we explored some NSFormatters and how to use them. We also explored some formatters introduced in iOS 13. Finally, a few weeks ago we learned about yet more formatters, and how to better use the ones we already had. In short, we have explored how powerful NSFormatter is. One thing we haven&amp;rsquo;t done yet though, is to write our own custom NSFormatter subclass.
NSFormatter NSFormatter is an abstract class.</description>

      <description>Sometimes we may be interested on how well our app is performing out there in the world. After all, our apps may be running in different environments that are hard to test or that Instruments may not catch.
For this purpose, Apple introduced MetricKit back in WWDC2019. MetricKit allows us to aggregate and analyze this benchmark data on a per-device basis, and not only does it include information on performance and battery usage, but also on exceptions and crash reports.</description>

      <description>A year ago, we talked about using NSFormatter for formatting data in a human readable format. WWDC2020 brings some updates and changes to the NSFormatter APIs that we need to be aware of. This article will complement the NSFormatter article from last year with best practices and things to look out for.
Improvements for Combinations of Languages and Regions. NSFormatter always does its best to format the data according to the user&amp;rsquo;s language and region where relevant.</description>

      <description>Translating our apps in different languages helps us reach wider audiences of different cultures. This reach can increase our app usage considerably and offer more monetization properties.
In this short article we will mention the features Apples gives us to translate our apps to different languages, namely NSLocalizedString and and stringsdict files. You will also understand when you will want to use each, as they have different use cases and an app that takes localization seriously will use both.</description>

      <guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/wwdc2020-whats-new-cryptokit/</guid>
      <description>CryptoKit, introduced in WWDC2019, allows us to perform cryptographic operations very easily.
While CryptoKit still doesn&amp;rsquo;t offer many algorithms and functionality, it&amp;rsquo;s still growing, and this year CryptoKit and do more.
HKDF Key derivation functions have been available from day one, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t possible to derive keys independently. It was only possible to do so if you were using elliptic curve key agreement protocols.
To do this, there is a new HKDF object with static methods.</description>

      <description>Last time we talked about the basics of the Unified Logging System, we set the basic concepts and code we need to write logs, along with the different logging levels, and more.
In this article we will talk about actually logging messages, how the framework is &amp;ldquo;smart enough&amp;rdquo; to strip out sensitive user info by default, and how we can control what gets stripped.
Logging Messages The framework supports interpolated strings right out of the box when you are using the new system in Swift.</description>

      <description>Working with REST APIs you have no control over can be a little monotonous. This is especially for OAuth 2.0 API that need you to do a little bit of setup, get your API keys with the service provider, and then you need to do the setup on your app&amp;rsquo;s size: Configure your URL scheme, deal with that URL Scheme, and write code that does something when your app gets called with that URL.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Apple&#39;s Unified Logging System on iOS 14 in Swift</title>
      <link>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/introduction-apples-unified-logging-system-ios14-swift/</link>

      <guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/introduction-apples-unified-logging-system-ios14-swift/</guid>
      <description>It is no surprise that software tend to write logs to a local file as they execute. As events, errors, or exceptional situations occur, a lot of software takes note of them using a local logging solution. This is done because these practices can allow us to troubleshoot problems for our users, find bugs, and in general understand the behavior of our software in untested or lesser tested scenarios.
When comes to iOS and other Apple platforms, there have always been third party dependencies that allow you to do this.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s not news that iOS has a heavy a focus on privacy and security. Apple provides us with many tools to make encryption easy, like CryptoKit, a high-level Cryptography framework on iOS. When CryptoKit is not enough, we can leverage older, lower-level APIs to do more cryptographic operations or use cyphers not covered by CryptoKit. We can even make use of the Secure Enclave to leverage hardware-level security to our apps.</description>

      <description>Combine allows us to create pipelines for a lot of tasks. Thanks to the fact it can do work concurrently without leveraging callbacks, it is very easy to build things that would otherwise be very complex.
In this short article, we will build a file download queue that downloads images sequentially. You can use this as the base for more complex queues.
The queue will download an array of images sequentially.</description>

      <guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/common-reasons-background-tasks-fail-ios/</guid>
      <description>Apple introduced modern background tasks last year on iOS 13. These new APIs have been out for a little over year (counting the beta period). Many developers have tried to adopt them to moderate success. Many of them have found them to be very unpredictable and that only work a fraction of the time. If you look around the internet (and even on the comments in that article), you will see many developers weren&amp;rsquo;t able to get them to work as expected.</description>

      <description>Xcode 12 introduces the ability for developers to add their own SwiftUI views and modifiers to the Xcode library. This allows people using your code to discover your custom views, makes your codebase easier to learn, and it allows you to visually edit complex views visually rather than with code.
In this short article we will explore how we can add our own views and modifiers to the Xcode library.</description>

      <description>Two of the concepts used a lot in Reactive Programming are the Future and Promises. Whether you have been using Combine for a while or are new to Reactive Programming, chances are you have seen these two words. These terms date to years ago. And I would be lying if I told you I knew what that they were for until I started learning Combine. The first time I heard about Futures and Promises was back in my NodeJS job half a decade ago, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand these concepts back then.</description>

      <description>There are times when we may want to share data across instances of our app running on different physical devices. You could develop a server or even leverage cloud storage, but did you know Apple provides a framework to share data directly across devices, without having to use an intermediary? This framework is the MultipeerConnectivity framework, and it has actually been around for a while. In this article, we will explore this framework to understand how we can use it to share data across instances of our app in different devices directly.</description>

      <description>UIMenu is a new set of APIs that were originally introduced in iOS 13. The API allows us to add menus to different parts of our UIs, including binding actions to key combinations when using your iOS or iPadOS device with a keyboard. Starting on iOS and iPadOS 14 (and ported to macOS Catalyst), this object is more prevalent in the UI thanks to the fact it can be invoqued from different actions.</description>

      <description>Earlier this week I was scrolling through my Twitter feed as usual and I found this tweet that made me realize I may have been handling errors incorrectly in Swift all my life. This prompted me to research a bit more about error handling in Swift, and it turns out there&amp;rsquo;s many specialized Error protocols you can conform to, and you should probably be using them over the default Error provided by the language.</description>

      <description>It is amazing what we can do with smartphones these days. Document scanning and text recognition are nothing new. But being able to have such a functionality in our pockets is pretty neat. These days we can create apps that have such features very quickly thanks to the push Apple has been doing to promote Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence on their devices.
Starting on iOS 11, we can natively scan documents with a system framework called VisionKit, and we can perform operations on images using a framework called Vision.</description>

      <description>If you have been using the keychain on your iOS apps you may want to start using Face ID/Touch ID to let your user access your app and their data. This is a common use case but it&amp;rsquo;s very easy to do incorrectly.
Apple introduced Touch ID all the way back in 2013, and ever since then, every iOS device has come with some sort of biometric authentication method, be it Touch ID or Face ID.</description>

      <description>This article is an entirely rewritten version of an old tutorial I wrote years ago titled &amp;ldquo;Using the iOS Keychain&amp;rdquo;. Originally written in Objective-C, the old version has been archived but it is accessible here.
The Keychain is the place where you would store sensitive data. As secure as iOS currently is, the keychain is the right place to store passwords, authentication tokens, and other sensitive data. You should not store this kind of data in UserDefaults, even if iOS has made it harder to access that data for normal users in the latest versions.</description>

      <description>A few years ago, Apple introduced the Content Blocking APIs to Safari. Using these APIs, developers are able to write extensions that allow Safari to block content users do not want to see.
Most commonly used for ads, content blockers are not really ad blockers. While they can, and commonly do, block ads, developers can write content blockers for all kind of content, including profanity, or other questionable content.

class DollInfoViewController: UIViewController { var dollModel: Doll? override func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() // Do any additional setup after loading the view. } } Or in the worst case, you may have seen code like this:
var dollModel: Doll! Then, when you want to create a view controller of that type you&amp;rsquo;d do:

      <description>There may be cases in which you need to find related words to others. With the NSLEmbedding class, you can find related strings based on the proximity of their vectors.
Using NLEmbedding Using NLEmbedding is very straight forward. A simple task is to get an array of related words, which come as an array of (String, NLDistance) back.
The distance between words tells you how &amp;ldquo;related&amp;rdquo; they are
let embedding = NLEmbedding.</description>

      <description>In the past few weeks, we have explored how we can tokenize natural language text and how to recognize the language a natural language text is written in. This week we will continue exploring more natural language APIs provided by the NaturalLanguage framework. We will learn about the NLTagger class, which allows us to to analyze natural language text to find parts of speech, lexical classes, lemma, scripts, and more. This API, introduced in iOS 12, implements machine learning to work, and just like the other NaturalLanguage classes, is very easy to use.</description>

      <description>Continuing my trend of writing about language processing, today I want to discuss about identifying the language of a body of text. This is an interesting task we can do thanks, once again, to Apple&amp;rsquo;s investment in APIs linked to machine learning.
Today we will explore the NLLanguageRecognizer object. Introduced in iOS 12, this class can do a lot of language recognizing, from detecting the &amp;ldquo;dominant language&amp;rdquo; of a string, to all the possible languages.</description>

      <description>iOS has a lot of APIs that deal with natural language detection. One such class is NSDataDetector. This class allows you to match different kinds of data in text, including dates, time, links, and more. This class, actually introduced a very long time ago (in the iOS 4.0 days!) makes it very easy to find this kind of data in strings. In this article we will explore how to use this very old class - whose documentation is Objective-C only at this time - in Swift, and how to do common tasks with it.</description>

      <description>As iOS becomes more advanced, features that we thought belonged to the long future start becoming more common place in today&amp;rsquo;s software. One such feature is speech recognition, which allows a device to take verbal input from a user, transcribe it into text, and do something with it.
In iOS, we can do this using a framework called Speech, and an object called SFSpeechRecognizer. With this class, you can perform all kinds of speech recognition tasks.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago, we talked about how we could play custom haptic feedbacks with CHHapticEngine. We saw how powerful and flexible that class is, letting us create different haptics for any context.
Sometimes though, you want to play simpler haptics to let the user know that something has occurred. The CHHapticEngine class can be overkill, and finding the right parameters to have interaction feedback can be very time consuming.</description>

Apple&amp;rsquo;s CryptoKit introduced this year is full of amazing features. Not only does it offer very easy to use cryptography, but it also offers an interface to a security feature that Apple introduced less than a decade ago: The Secure Enclave.
The Secure Enclave is a hardware feature for helping the system work with cryptographically secure data. In this article, we will build upon our previous CryptoKit knowledge (see the article linked above), and we will also learn what the Secure Enclave is all about.</description>

      <description>All the way back to 2016, a group of very talented iOS developers released Workflow, a very popular app to let users create actions of different kinds within the system&amp;rsquo;s constraints. You could create and automate different tasks, such as controlling a server via SSH, downloading all the images from a website, and more&amp;hellip; Much, much more.
Apple saw the power of the app and acquired it in March 2017. This was very exciting, but we didn&amp;rsquo;t hear anything from the app since.</description>

AIiCloudSync AIiCloudSync is a simple Package written in Swift to synchronize specific UserDefaults with the iCloud Key Value store (NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore).
To use this package, create a single instance of AIiCloudSync, and keep a reference to it. Once you create it, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about it any longer. It will automatically sync changes between iCloud and your local UserDefaults through the lifetime of your application. You can optionally receive notifications when the iCloud Syncs change so you can react accordingly.</description>

      <description>In the article from last week, we explored the basic background execution APIs introduced since iOS 7. We explored how we could request additional time for a task to complete after entering the background, how we could defer downloads with URLSession, and how we could use silent push notifications to trigger background tasks.
The story with background tasks does not end there. iOS 13 introduced more APIs to do better background tasks, and that allow you to do things that weren&amp;rsquo;t possible before.</description>

      <description>In the early days of iOS development, developers had no way at all to perform background tasks beyond a very limited constraints of tasks, like music playback. Modern demands go beyond allowing people to play music in your app while they use a different app, and we as developers need to adapt to these changes. VoIP, lengthy networking, and even silent pushes to keep an app updated are very common these days, and fulfilling these demands used to be hard, if not outright impossible.</description>

      <description>Formatting Relative Dates With RelativeDateTimeFormatter
A few weeks ago we talked about formatting content with NSFormatter, an abstract class from which multiple formatting classes inherit from to allow you to format different kinds of data in a human-readable form. NSFormatter is not only a class you can inherit from yourself, but as iOS evolves, more formatters will be added to its family. This week, we will explore a new member of this family introduced in iOS 13: RelativeDateTimeFormatter.</description>

      <description>Soon after I published this article, Christian Tietze wrote a fair criticism of this idea here.
Once you understand how property wrappers work, you can use this article to apply it to user defaults. The main idea is that property wrappers allow you to store your values differently and even externally. That said, you may or may not want to implement this in a real app. I recommend you read this article first, and then go back to Christian&amp;rsquo;s to see more downsides of this idea other than the ones I mentioned below.</description>

You have likely asked yourself why some parsing code is not working as expected, or why a request seems to have an invalid format. Intercepting your own network calls with a proxy can help you find the answer to these questions.</description>

      <description>iOS has always provided interesting search APIs, but they have always been limited and doing the most interesting tasks required you to either write your own implementation or use private APIs.
iOS 13 has provided some very nice improvements to the UI search APIs. In this article we will talk about two of them.
UISearchBar finally exposes its text field I have been using UISearchController and UISearchBar for a very long time, and I have always found it bizarre that Apple didn&amp;rsquo;t expose its underlying text field property.</description>

As I have been playing with the amazing CryptoKit framework in the past few weeks, I have discovered a few more things that CryptoKit currently doesn&amp;rsquo;t do. This is not generally a bad thing, and I think these limitations are related to what seem to be the goal of the framework:</description>

      <guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/pattern-matching/</guid>
      <description>Swift is a beautiful language, but it hides some powerful features from developers who come from more &amp;ldquo;old-style&amp;rdquo; programming languages such as C++ and Java. One such feature is Pattern Matching, and it allows you to write some cleaner code when dealing with some operations.
For example, consider casting. Casting is a feature in the vast majority of statically-typed languages. Casting is considered to be an ugly operation by some, because when you need to cast, it&amp;rsquo;s usually because the language has a flaw that prevents it from telling you about the right data type underneath.</description>

      <description>Sometimes when you are writing an app, you need to be notified of events occurring somewhere else in the system - either in your own app, or in the operating system - and react to them accordingly. For example, you may be an app like Snapchat and you want to know when a screenshot has been taken. This is a system notification that you can &amp;ldquo;listen&amp;rdquo; to in order to react.</description>

Apple providing new cryptography tools is nothing new. They have provided the Security framework for a very long time, and a few years later they introduced CommonCrypto. The problem with these frameworks is that they can be very low level, being written in C, and it can be intimidating for new developers to adopt them in their project.</description>

      <description>Vibration and physical feedback has become an important feature of Apple&amp;rsquo;s operating systems. Starting with the Apple Watch, Apple replaced the traditional vibration feedback with haptic feedback hardware, which allowed them to have more control over how vibrations and physical feedback work.
First being introduced in the Apple Watch, Haptic Feedback has been a core part of the Apple ecosystem experience since. Just think about it, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be weird if you force-touched the screen to do something, and there was no physical response from the device?</description>

This is to recognize the iPad as its own independent entity that has its own set of features compared to iOS. Amongst those features, iPadOS adds Multiwindow support, which allows our apps to run in more than one Window at the same time.

      <description>Error handling when expecting a result out of an operation is a very common thing to do. For this reason, various high-level programming languages have introduced a Result type into their libraries, on top of their existing error-handling features. This feature was implemented in Swift 5.
A Result wraps a success or a failure. It is essentially an enum with two possible cases: .success and .failure. The .success case wraps the correct result of an operation, whereas a .</description>

      <description>If you have been programming for Apple platforms for a while, chances are you have seen (or maybe even wrote yourself) a line of code that looks like this:
let url = URL(string: &amp;#34;https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=pullip&amp;#34;)! Whether you wrote it yourself or someone else did it, one thing is clear: This is not a safe way to build URLs. Can you know, for sure, that your URL is actually valid? Intuitively, all of us can see a URL and see if it&amp;rsquo;s valid, but there is a whole lot of governing in the URL format that at some point we may find funny URLs that look valid and aren&amp;rsquo;t, or the other way around; they look invalid, but aren&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

      <description>When we are working with apps on iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, or TVOS, it&amp;rsquo;s possible that at some point we will have to store and retrieve a lot of temporary data throughout the lifecycle of our software. Depending on our needs, we may need to cache data on disk and manually manage it ourselves, or we may only need it to cache it in memory. In the case of the latter, Apple offers NSCache, a mutable collection that lets us cache files in memory using key-value pairs.</description>

      <description>Discontinued project, but a new version is in the works. Developed in 2014.
Mignori is a mobile client to use with -booru or -booru based sites (Gelbooru and Danbooru, to name a few).
A -booru imageboard is simply a board where people post pictures and tag with them relevant attributes. This allows other users to search for images in these boards and find images with the qualities they’re looking for.</description>

      <description>Discontinued project. Developed in 2013.
If you want to protect app data from your friends or family that are constantly asking for your iDevice, there are a couple of things you can do: You can tell them not to enter certain apps, empowering their curiosity and therefore exposing your private data, or you can passcode-lock certain apps, which if they see, they will just wonder what you’re hiding that they can’t see.</description>

      <description>Discontinued project. Developed in 2013.
A friend of mine had his hardware ringer of his phone die on him. Because of that, toggling the ringer on and off was quite a chore for him. Without installing SBSettings or anything equivalent to that, he had to go to the settings app and toggle the ringer on and off there.
So he asked me to write an icon on SpringBoard that would toggle the ringer.</description>

      <description>Discontinued project. Developed in 2012.
Sideswitch Toggles is a MobileSubstrate tweak that gives you full control over your iPhone’s Ringer (and as such, it isn’t available for the iPod Touch). The tweak simply modifies the action that happens when you toggle the ringer on and off.
By default, Sideswitch Toggles comes with the ability to toggle Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Airplane Mode, and Do Not Disturb. The capabilities of Sideswitch can be easily extended by other developers.</description>

      <description>Discontinued project. Developed in 2011
SiLight is a small AssistantExtension that allows Siri to turn on your phone’s torch to use it as a flashlight. SiLight is a real quick flashlight, since commands work in the Lockscreen too. SiLight was programmed having natural speech in mind, instead of talking to her like a robot (“flashlight on”) you can ask her as you would ask anyone (“I need a flashlight”, “Siri, there’s a blackout”).</description>

      <description>It is amazing what we can do with smartphones these days. Document scanning and text recognition are nothing new. But being able to have such a functionality in our pockets is pretty neat. These days we can create apps that have such features very quickly thanks to the push Apple has been doing to promote Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence on their devices.

I am very happy to announce that I have successfully written and published my first book on Apple Platforms development. If you were wondering why I haven't blogged in over a year, this is the reason.

Earlier this year I was contacted by Apress to write a topic on this after they saw my blog tutorial series on this topic. It is important to note, that this book is not just a copy paste of those articles in book form. The book was rewritten from scratch, I have revised some of the commonly asked questions and comments, I have added examples, and I have created a book combining all that knowledge into a few chapters. My blog series on modern concurrency may be good for most people, but, that said if you find it isn't enough, please consider giving the book a chance. I poured my soul into it, and there were tons of amazing people helping me make it a reality.

You can purchase the book as both as an eBook or print from [Springer Link](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-8695-1)

I don't want to have anything fancy here, but you should know that:

1. This website is hosted on Github for free. They may or may not collect your IP and other information that can be used to identify you. Please check their own policy.
2. I am using Google Analytics. I do not care about tracking specific users. All I care about is how well my pages are doing, who is linking to me, my referrers, etc.. I am not willingly collecting anything that can personally identify you.
3. This website is generated with a static website generator called Hugo. This webpage is not running any server-side code that I am aware of. I am not willingly setting any cookies on your computer.
4. I am currently using Cloudflare for the purpose of statistics (so I can compare it how well it fares against Google).
5. In generally, I don't care who you are or where you come from, but I care about the website that sent you here.

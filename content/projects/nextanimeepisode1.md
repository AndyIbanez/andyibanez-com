Next Anime Episode does one job: To help you keep track of airing anime and when they will have a new episode available in Japan.

Generally, sub based simulcast streaming services have the newest episodes available within one hour after they air in Japan.

Simply browse the currently airing chart, select which anime you are interested in, and you will receive a notification when a new episode for your selected series is available. It’s that easy! You can also monitors what will be airing next, as Next Anime Episode will show you your anime series sorted by the closest episode first.

### Features:

* Instant push notifications when a new episode airs.
* Easy access to view all the anime that is airing this season in Japan, to let you easily pick which ones you are interested in.
* The Notifications are highlighted with a badge to help you keep track of what you are interested in but haven’t watched yet. You can mark Episodes as “Watched” anytime. Doing so also decreases the notification count.
* Monitor what episodes will air next, as they are displayed in order of closest next episode in the Watching tab.

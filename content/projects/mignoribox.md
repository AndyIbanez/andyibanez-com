![Mignori Box](/img/mignoribox.png)

*Discontinued project. Developed in 2014.*

Mignori Box was a service to download your [Mignori 1](/projects/mignori1/) collections to your computer.

The website was built using the classic web technologies. Twitter Bootstrap and jQuery for the front-end, PHP and even Bash for the backend. The site was hosted in a VPS provided by DigitalOcean.

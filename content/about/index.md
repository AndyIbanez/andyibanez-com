I'm a software developer born and raised in La Paz, Bolivia.

I started my university studies at [Universidad Privada Boliviana](http://www.ucb.edu.bo) in 2011. The career I was pursuing was simply "Systems Engineering". I didn't finish my degree there. Instead, I transferred to [Universidad Privada Boliviana](http://www.upb.edu) in late 2012 because the program was much more interesting. I finished all my courses in July 9, 2018 and I'm currently working on my thesis to get my degree in Computer Systems Engineering. In college I was involved in a few entrepreneurships all related to app development in Bolivia.

I mostly write iOS apps in both Objective-C and Swift, though I adopted the latter in the first version and have been using it almost exclusively since then. I have published many apps in the App Store throughout the years, and many have come and gone. I published my first app in 2011 when I was a college freshman; it was a simple numerical base converter which I was using for my computer science classes at the time. My most popular app is [Mignori](https://www.mignori.com), which used to be on the App Store, but I removed it to publish a better version sometime this year.

For a few years, I was involved in the iOS Jailbreak community, because doing basic reverse engineering to Apple's apps (and other people's apps) in order to make them behave differently was fun. I used to write tutorials for Jailbreak development in my blog. I stopped jailbreaking sometime in 2014 or 2015, so I am no longer involved with the community.

During college, I started working as a freelancer iOS developer. I was lucky, because iOS developers are a minority in Bolivia, so finding freelancing jobs was not hard. I've worked for various clients, most notably  [BZ Group](http://www.bz-group.com), one of the biggest marketing and software development houses in the country.

I also use other technologies and languages. PHP is another language I use a lot - whether that's a good or a bad thing, I'll leave it up to you to decide. I have built a few Android apps in Java as well, but I was never interested in developing that skill much further beyond that. In general, I enjoy learning programming languages of all kinds and purposes, but the ones I use the most are a few - Swift, Objective-C, and a classical webstack with PHP, MySQL and Apache.
